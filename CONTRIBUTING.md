# Contributing

We want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## How can I contribute?

- **Give us a star.** It may not seem like much, but it really makes a
  difference. This is something that everyone can do to help out Ory CLI. Github
  stars help the project gain visibility and stand out.

- **Join the community.** Sometimes helping people can be as easy as listening
  to their problems and offering a different perspective. Join our Slack, have a
  look at discussions in the forum and take part in community events. More info
  on this in [Communication](#communication).

- **Help with open issues.** Sometimes, issues lack necessary information and some
  are duplicates of older issues.
  You can help out by guiding people through the process of filling out the
  issue template, asking for clarifying information or pointing them to existing
  issues that match their description of the problem.

- **Review documentation changes.** Most documentation just needs a review for
  proper spelling and grammar. If you think a document can be improved in any
  way, feel free to hit the `edit` button at the top of the page. More info on
  contributing to the documentation [here](#contribute-documentation).

- **Help with tests.** Pull requests may lack proper tests or test plans. These
  are needed for the change to be implemented safely.

- **Create a pull request.**

## Communication

- We use [Discord](https://discord.gg/v7sbenECgC)
- You can also join us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kubessandra)

## Pull request process

All contributions are made via pull requests. To make a pull request, you will
need a GitHub account; if you are unclear on this process, see GitHub's
documentation on [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Pull
requests should be targeted at the `main` branch.

1. Create a feature branch off of `main` so that changes do not get mixed up.
2. [Rebase](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) your local
   changes against the `main` branch.

If a pull request is not ready to be reviewed yet
[it should be marked as a "Draft"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request).

### Working with forks

```bash
# First you clone the original repository
git clone git@github.com:kubessandra/KubeStack.git
# Next you add a git remote that is your fork:
git remote add fork git@github.com:<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME-HERE>/KubeStack.git
# Next you fetch the latest changes from origin for master:
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull --rebase
# Next you create a new feature branch off of master:
git checkout my-feature-branch
# Now you do your work and commit your changes:
git add -A
git commit -a -m "fix: this is the subject line" -m "This is the body line. Closes #123"
# And the last step is pushing this to your fork
git push -u fork my-feature-branch
```

Now go to the project's GitHub Pull Request page and click "New pull request"

## Setup

### PNPM

First, you will need to have [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) installed on your machine.

From the [installation page](https://pnpm.io/installation), choose your preferred install method and run it.

### NodeJS

Next, you'll need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, with the required version. The required version is specified in the [`.npmrc`](.npmrc) root file, aswell as in every `package.json` file :

Feel free to use the node-version manager of your choice (like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)), but we recommend using the integrated manager of pnpm. The [`pnpm env`](https://pnpm.io/fr/cli/env) command allows you to manage whatever node engine pnpm should use. Go into any `package.json` file and find the required node version, then enter the following command :

```sh
$ pnpm env use --global 18.4.0
```

If you enter the wrong version, or if the required node version changes, pnpm will throw errors until you make the apropriate changes.

> :information_source: Using the `pnpm env` command, pnpm will resolve a separate node instance from the one you installed on your system. Note that the _pnpm_ version will be used for dependencies resolution **aswell** as for scripts.

### Ory CLI

For authentication, the [KubeStack](https://github.com/Kubessandra/KubeStack) uses [Ory](https://www.ory.sh/docs/welcome).

In order to be run locally, Ory relies on it's CLI to create a proxy tunnel to the API.

Install the CLI through the [official documentation page](https://www.ory.sh/docs/getting-started/local-development).

Once installed, you will need an account and a project. To do so, follow the [official guide](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/cli/cli-basics#create-ory-network-account-and-project).
You should end up using `ory auth` to create / log-in to an account, and `ory create project` to create a new
project if needed. You then should be shown some metadata about your project, in particular the project's `SLUG`, which should be inserted as the `ORY_PROJECT_SLUG` env variable.

If any of these informations / steps is missing, the app will fail to start.

> :information_source: Authentication and project-creation can also be done using the console at [console.ory.sh](https://console.ory.sh/).

### Environment variables.

You need to replace every `.env.example` that you can find by a `.env` with your environment variables.

You can find a `.env.example` in:

- `apps/web`
- `package/database`

## Development workflow

To get started with the project, run `pnpm` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

### Commit message convention

We follow the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en) for our commit messages:

- `fix`: bug fixes, e.g. fix crash due to deprecated method.
- `feat`: new features, e.g. add new method to the module.
- `refactor`: code refactor, e.g. migrate from class components to hooks.
- `docs`: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for the module..
- `test`: adding or updating tests, e.g. add integration tests using detox.
- `chore`: tooling changes, e.g. change CI config.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that your commit message matches this format when committing.

### Linting and tests

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting and formatting the code, and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that the linter and tests pass when committing.

```sh
pnpm lint
pnpm lint-fix
```

### Sending a pull request

> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

When you're sending a pull request:

- Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.
- Verify that linters and tests are passing.
- Review the documentation to make sure it looks good.
- Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.
- For pull requests that change the API or implementation, discuss with maintainers first by opening an issue.
